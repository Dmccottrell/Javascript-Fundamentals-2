    Write a function called describeCountry which takes three parameters: country, population and capitalCity. Based on this input, the function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its capital city is Helsinki'.

    Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console.

//FUNCTION DECLARATIONS VS EXPRESSIONS

/* The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called percentageOfWorld1 which receives a population value, and returns the percentage of the world population that the given population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

To calculate the percentage, divide the given population value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.

Call percentageOfWorld1 for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, and log them to the console.

Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called percentageOfWolrd2, and also call it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).

To calculate the percentage, describePopulation calls the percentageOfWorld1 you created earlier.

Call describePopulation with data for 3 countries of your choice.

//ARRAYS

/* Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice. You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a variable called populations.

Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false).

Create an array called percentages containing the percentages of the world population for these 4 population values. Use the function percentageOfWorld1 that you created earlier to compute the 4 percentage values.

//Methods Arrays
/* Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array into a variable called neighbours.

At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country, so add it to the end of the neighbours array.

Unfortunately, after some time the new country is dissolved, so remove it from the end of the array.

If the neighbours array does not include the country 'Germany', log to the console: 'Probably not a central european country :D'.

Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that, find the index of the country in the neighbours array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

// Confirm that percentages2 contains exactly the same values as the percentages array that we created manually in the previous assignment, and reflect on how much better this solution is.

//LOOPING BACKWARDS and LOOPS in LOOPS

// Store this array of arrays into a variable called listOfNeighbours:

// [['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden', 'Russia']];
// Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country.

// You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ðŸ˜‰

		console.log(`Neighbour: ${listOfNeighbours[i][y]}`);

//THE WHILE LOOP
// Recreate the challenge from the lecture Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing, but this time using a while loop (call the array percentages3).

// Reflect on what solution you like better for this task: the for loop or the while loop?
